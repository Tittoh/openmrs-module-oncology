Purpose
-------

This document captures options gathered during first week of discussions about how to implement ordering of oncology (chemo specifcally) treatment regimens within OpenMRS Mirebalais distro and provide dashboard analytics about their treatment.


Context
-------

This capability is being added as part of a 3-week on-site engagement between PIH and IBM teams. The goal is to provide a completed set of features for use with Mirebalais distro. 

The scope was focused on doctor-centric workflow during initial consultation/diagnosis of a cancer patient which requires doctor order chemotherapy treatment which is likely to be recurring and re-validated during each cycle visit.

This doctor workflow's use cases are not currently part of Mirebalais distro are:
- Order a chemo treatment from a well-known list of oncology regimens (i.e. templates), this includes ability to adjust drug values before submitting final order.
- Modify chemo treatment - after initial ordering - if needed based on doctor's assessment of patient's reaction to treatment regimen.
- Review patient's historical (dashboard) oncology treatment data (i.e. longitudinal view) when needed.


Assumptions
-----------

- OpenMRS 2.1.3 (or higher) platform w/ Mirebalais distro deployment (i.e. concept dictionary, modules, UI, etc).
- Oncology regimens supported in this effort will (at a minimum) cover the scope of Haiti's chemotherapy treatment forms provided:

    - Paclitaxel175ReChallenge.pptx
- Dictionary dataset (i.e. concepts and related metadata) might (and can) be modified using PIH dataset process.
- Data model could be extended or modified, if needed.


Functional Requirements
=======================

The updated system with oncology treatment ordering capability will leverage existing data model objects and api semantics as much as possible. There is already a substantial coverage of required modeling for supporting oncology regimens. Data concepts such as `OrderSet`, `OrderGroup`, and `Order` provide base for most of the above data interactions.


Use Cases
=========

**Doctor (DR)** use cases (primary data model classes involved are `Patient`, `OrderGroup`, `Order`, `OrderSet`, `OrderSetMember`, `OrderType`, `Encounter`):
- DR_UC1: As a doctor, I want to select and edit a chemotherapy regimen from a pre-configured set available during ordering.
- DR_UC2: As a doctor, I want to submit an order for the selected chemotherapy regimen in DR_UC1 use case.
- DR_UC3: As a doctor, I want to modify chemotherapy regimen *initially ordered* for a patient (i.e. before final order confirmation).
- DR_UC4: As a doctor, I want to modify chemotherapy regimen *previously ordered* for a patient (i.e. order is already in data model)

---

**Adminstrative (AD)** use cases (primary data model classes involved are):
- AD_UC1: As a nurse, I want to capture chemotherapy delivery observations for treatment cycle received on a specific visit.
- AD_UC2: As a nurse, I want to ...

---

**Order Templates (OT)** use cases (primary data model classes involved are `OrderSet`, `OrderSetMember`, `OrderType`):
- OT_UC1: As an oncology clinician, I want to author oncology regimen templates for use in EMR solution.
- OT_UC2: As an oncology clinician, I want to update an existing oncology regimen template currently in use in EMR solution.

Technical Flows
===============

- Data Model: 
![](../images/muraly-data-model.png)

DR_UC1 - Select chemotherapy regimen from list 
------

- Summary flow:
  1. Query all `OrderSet` templates available, returns array
  2. For each `OrderSet` in array above, query each `OrderSet`, `OrderSetMember`, `Concept`, `OrderType`, `OrderTemplate` detail attributes
  3. Use `OrderSet` indication attribute to group regimen classifications (i.e. "Chemotherapy" vs. "HIV")

- Implementation notes: Data encoded in `OrderSetMember.orderTemplate` is a seralized escaped JSON string that must be decoded in presentation later to understand data. When creating `Order` objects in the next use case, the final JSON string must be serialized similarly containing the updated (if applicable) chemotherapy drugs being ordered by doctor in final initial order.

response: HTTP 200 [body](samples/get-ordersetmember-response.json)  
  
  
DR_UC2 - Submit an order for the selected chemotherapy regimen in DR_UC1 use case
------

- Summary flow:
  1. Get the current `Provider` (based on who is logged in, get from the session)
  2. Get the `EncounterRole` (this will be fixed for all orders, so just need a hard coded query) `https://humci.pih-emr.org/mirebalais/ws/rest/v1/encounterrole?q=Ordering%20Provider`
  3. Get the `Encounter` type (fixed again, need a hard coded query) `https://humci.pih-emr.org/mirebalais/ws/rest/v1/encountertype?q=Test%20Order`
  4. Get the current `Location` (get from the session)
  5. Get the `Patient` ID (hopefully this comes from the page/url that we are given)
  6. Construct the `OrderGroup` and `Order` objects and submit as described below

- Implementation notes: Response from the `POST /mirebalais/ws/rest/v1/encounter` request returns the same document submitted but with more of the fields completed, e.g. the UUID for the Encounter which has just been created. encounter role is a description of the type of person who is involved in the encounter (e.g. nurse) For existing drug orders, it looks like this is retreived with a query to `https://humci.pih-emr.org/mirebalais/ws/rest/v1/encounterrole?q=Ordering%20Provider`. Provider looks like a wrapper around person - not sure how to get this.

OT_UC1 - Authoring an oncology regimen templates for use in EMR solution
------

- Summary flow:
  1. Download and rename one of the existing regimens available from this repo folder: ([here](https://github.com/dearmasm/openmrs-module-oncology/tree/master/regimens)).
  2. Edit newly created regimen definition file to contain the new chemotherapy treatment orders and dosages (premedications drugs, chemo drugs, post medication drugs).
  3. Use Regimen Automation Management (YAAR) tool ([here](https://github.com/dearmasm/openmrs-module-oncology/tree/master/utils)) to validate and test your new chemotherapy regimen definition.
  4. Save new chemotherapy regimen into your OpenMRS module repo/project leverage YAAR tool for deploying regimens onto target system (note the just-in-time UUID lookup logic that the tool allows for supporting portable drug concepts)

- Usage information for **`Yet Another Automated Regimen (YAAR)`** management tool:  
 Reference [YAAR documentation](https://github.com/dearmasm/openmrs-module-oncology/blob/master/utils/YAAR_DOCS.md) for usage and implementation details.

OT_UC2 - Editing an oncology regimen templates currently in use in an EMR solution
------


- Summary flow:
  1. There is chemotherapy regimen currently in use in an OpenMRS instance and it needs to be updated (for example, add/remove drug treatment detail or cycle information).
  2. Using YAAR tool (or other method), find the `UUID` for chemotherapy regimen `OrderSet` object instance you want to update.
  3. Edit regimen input file associated with `OrderSet` template you want to target.
  4. Apply changes to existing regimen using YAAR tool `UPDATE` capability (described in OT_UC1 section).
  5. Using YAAR tool (or other method), review updates applied to chemotherapy regimen `OrderSet` `UUID` object instance you provided in prior step.  
    
    
 - Usage Example:  
   
   - Fetch all regimens (i.e. all non-retired `OrderSet`s) in an OpenMRS system
     ```bash session
     $ ./yaar.sh -get localhost-server.conf > all-regimens.json
     ```
   - Search `all-regimens.json` for the chemotherapy regimen order set that needs to be updated (let's assume the UUID for that order set regimen is `131168f4-15f5-102d-96e4-000c29c2a5d7`).
   - Fetch the specific `foo` regimen's metadata and save in file `regimen-foo.json` for reference.  
    ```bash session
     $ ./yaar.sh -get localhost-server.conf 131168f4-15f5-102d-96e4-000c29c2a5d7 > regimen-foo.json
     ```
   - Examine `regimen-foo.json` to confirm that this is the chemotherapy regimen order set that we want to update.
   - Now let's udpate order set regimen with latest regimen template file metadata (let's assume it is called `foo.yaml`).
   - ```bash session
     $ ./yaar.sh -update localhost-server.conf foo.yaml 131168f4-15f5-102d-96e4-000c29c2a5d7 > updated-regimen-foo.json
     ```     
   - Fetch `foo` regimen's metadata again and save in a new file `updated-regimen-foo.json` for comparison in next step.  
     ```bash session
     $ ./yaar.sh -get localhost-server.conf 131168f4-15f5-102d-96e4-000c29c2a5d7 > regimen-foo.json
     ```
   - Finally, compare `updated-regimen-foo.json` with `regimen-foo.json` to confirm that all the updates to chemotherapy regimen `foo`'s metadata were applied.  
     
       
       

Proposal
========
Several objects in the data model are missing fields that are necessary for the chemotherapy regimen ordering workflow. These objects and the missing fields are:
- Drug
    - Maximum lifetime dose
- OrderGroup
    - Cycle number
    - Physician notes
    - Indication (Chemotherapy/HIV)
    - Number of cycles in the regimen
    - Length of the cycles in the regimen
    - Previous Order Group
    - Nesting of Order Groups
- OrderSet
    - Indication (Chemotherapy/HIV)
    - Number of cycles typical in the regimen
    - Length of cycles typical in the regimen
- DrugOrder
    - Dosing reduction

For OrderSet, the Category field will contain a reference to a Concept which describes what a particular OrderSet is typically used to treat. If an OrderSet is used for multiple situations, the Concept for the OrderSet would be a Concept of type Set, which has the multiple Concepts as members of the Set. OrderSet will also be extended via attributes to hold the attributes of number of cycles and length of the cycles.

OrderGroup will contain a field called "orderGroupReason" which will be a concept denoting the reason the orderGroup was "ordered" - in our case, this would always be "Chemotherapy", "Cancer Treatment", or a similar value. Physician notes will be contained in an Observation in the Encounter associated with the OrderGroup. The fields PreviousOrderGroup, ParentOrderGroup, and NestedOrderGroups will be added to the OrderGroup object to support linking OrderGroups as well as OrderGroup nesting. OrderGroup nesting will be used to group chemotherapy regimens into Premedications, Chemotherapy medications, and Post Medications. OrderGroup will also be extended via attributes to associate the fields of cycle number, the number of total cycles in the regimen at that point in time, and the length of the cycles in the regimen.

For dosing reduction, we will implement a new dosing type to capture the dosing adjustment. This will capture the percent of the adjustment, as well as have fields for timing and dilution instructions.

For maximum lifetime dose, it is typically associated with the drug concept or ingredient, and not a specific formulation. As such, we will associate the maximum lifetime dose to a drug Concept via ConceptAttributes.

Drug currently has a maximumDailyDose field (which is a double), but no concept of the units associated with it. We are intending to add a doseLimitUnits field to the table which is the Concept referring to the particular units that the max and min daily dose fields use.

We would like to capture the concentration of a drug in a more concrete form than just in the name of the Drug, as we need to fetch that value for calculating the dosage in our application. We will store the concentration value and its units serialized in the strength field of the Drug.
