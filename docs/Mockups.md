**Descriptive mockups** 
This is a word document that decribes the different screens included in ordering chemo and adding administration details. 

All screens have a name and a background description. The background description often describe the scenario of how to get to the screen and any preconditions to get there.

All screens are marked with green circles with numbers in them. All numbers point to a functionality that is described under the heading "functionalities" for each section.

**Additional mockups** 

In addition to the mockups for the user scenario that was the focus of this project. Other mockups were also created as concepts of what next steps could be.

This mockups shows:
- Additional information on the dashboard
- Calculation page
- Expanded form for documenting chemo ordering.

This mockups are concepts to show how the design could look like and what the flow could be. There has not been any user research done on them. Before any implementation is done, it is strongly recomended that user research and test is done.
