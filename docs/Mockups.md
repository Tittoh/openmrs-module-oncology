Purpose:
--------
 The focus for the this project:  
- That a doctor can order and track a patient's chemo treatment.  
- That the nurse's can add adminstration details of what was given to the patient to support quality of care. 

Main Deliverables:
--------

**Descriptive mockups** 
This is a word document that decribes the different screens included in ordering chemo and adding administration details.
All screens have a name and a background description. The background description often describe the scenario of how to get to the screen and any preconditions to get there.

All screens are marked with green circles with numbers in them. All numbers point to a functionality that is described under the heading "functionalities" for each image in the document.

**Mockups** 

This is a pdf file that contains clear mockups without any descriptive text.

**Sketch** 

This is the sketch file that contains all mockups that were created it also includes Material UI components & Theme.

**Note** A majority of the components and the functionality in the mockups were implemented. The missing components and functionality are identified in the gap document.

Additional Deliverables:
--------

**Additional Mockups** 

In addition to the main deliverables that were builded. Other mockups were also created as concepts of what next steps could be.

This mockups shows:
- Cancer Dashboard
- Chemo Calculations
- Chemo Extended administration

This mockups are concepts to show how the design could look like and what the flow could be. There has not been any user research done on them. Before any implementation is done, it is strongly recommended that user research and test is done to verify the accuracy and need of the design.

**Regimen Template data** 

This is the regimen data structured in a excel file.

Design Recommendations:
--------

- Create a detailed style guide that contains all components that are used and a descriptive text when and why they are used. This is important to keep the design consistent and makes it easier to scale the solution. A well created style guide makes is easier for new designers to quickly get up to speed and the solution is less dependent on individual's.
